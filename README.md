Teleregilo
==========

Teleregilo is a toybox (\*) for controlling services on a network through HTTP
or sockets or anything really with a remote control and a running LIRC server.
Some inspiration came from plircc (http://tardyp.free.fr/plircc/)

Demo features: speaking clock in Esperanto and English with Festival TTS, and
admonition for launching missiles, deactivating and activating Motion video surveillance system
